Scripts and tools related to Redmine and Git server administration
==================================================================

See <script> -h for invocation details.

redupdate
---------
Create or update Redmine issues via the command line.
Runs on the Redmine server only, so use via ssh.
It's a shell script, so there are no undocumented Ruby-dependencies!

redupload
---------
Uploads a file into a Redmine project. Usage:
$ redupload <server> <project> <file>
Uses Perl and WWW::Mechanize (libwww-mechanize-perl on Debian).

miner
-----
A daemon to query each branch of the Repository of a Redmine project
periodically, one branch every 15s.
Benefits:
* your virtual machine alway gets some processor power assigned
* the issue-commit links are kept up to date, whithout having to check the Repo

Start from /etc/rc.local as a daemon:
miner <project> &

gitemail
--------
Meant to be called from the post-receive hook of a git repo, to inform the
maintainer about pushes. Needs mutt to send emails.

gitcreate
---------
Creates a bare git repo, sets up its post-update hook for http access and,
if an email address is specified, sets up a gitemail call into the
post-receive hook.

Typical usage:
$ gitcreate foo bar@baz.com
This will create the bare repo foo.git in the current dir, set up http access,
and install gitemail into the post-receive hook to notify the maintainer
about pushes.
